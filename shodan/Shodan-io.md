# Task 1 Introduction 

What is an Autonomous System Number (ASN) 

>Autonomous System Number (ASN) is a globally unique identifier that defines a group of one or more IP prefixes run by one or more network operators that maintain a single, 
>clearly-defined routing policy. These groups of IP prefixes are known as autonomous systems. The ASN allows the autonomous systems to exchange routing information with other autonomous systems.
>Network operators across the world need Autonomous System Numbers to control routing within their networks as well as exchange routing information with other network operators
>- example; Internet Service providers.
